# Privacy Policy – The Weather Recap

**Last updated: December 7, 2025**

This Privacy Policy describes how The Weather Recap (“the App”) handles information when you use it.
The App is published by Claret Bioscience, Inc. (“we”, “us”, or “our”).

## 1. Data we collect

The App itself does not require you to create an account and does not collect your name, email address, or other directly identifying information.

The App may process:

### Location-related data you provide
When you search for and add a place (e.g. “London, United Kingdom”), the App sends the place name to a third-party geocoding service (Open-Meteo) to look up latitude/longitude. We do not store any user identifiers with this data.

### Weather data
The App requests weather and forecast data from third-party APIs based on selected locations.

### Analytics & advertising data
We use Google AdMob to display ads. Google and its partners may collect device information, approximate location, and advertising identifiers in order to show and measure ads. This data is processed according to Google’s policies, not directly by us.

## 2. Advertising (AdMob)

We use Google AdMob to serve banner ads and interstitial ads in the App.  
AdMob may collect and process data such as:

- Device identifiers (e.g. IDFA)  
- IP address and approximate location  
- Interaction with ads  

This information is used for:

- Delivering and measuring ads  
- Fraud detection and security  
- Reporting and analytics  

Google’s use of data is governed by the Google Privacy Policy and the AdMob/Google Mobile Ads policies. For more information, see:

- Google Privacy Policy: https://policies.google.com/privacy  
- AdMob Help: https://support.google.com/admob  

On iOS, Apple may require your permission to track you across apps and websites owned by other companies. The system permission dialog (“Allow tracking?”) is controlled by iOS; you can change your choice at any time in **Settings → Privacy & Security → Tracking**.

## 3. How we store and share data

- We do not sell your personal data.  
- We do not create user accounts or store your identity in our own database.  
- Weather and location data is stored on our backend only as needed to generate the app’s overview and forecast views.  
- Ad-related data is handled primarily by Google AdMob as described above.  
- We may store limited logs (such as error logs) to maintain and improve the App. These logs may include IP address and device information but are not used to identify individual users.

## 4. Your choices

### Tracking & personalized ads
You can allow or deny tracking via the iOS system prompt. You can change this later under **Settings → Privacy & Security → Tracking**.

### Deleting the App
You can delete the App from your device at any time. This removes any local data stored on your device (such as your list of saved places).

## 5. Children’s privacy

The App is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so we can delete it.

## 6. Changes to this policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the “Last updated” date at the top of this page. Material changes may also be noted in the App release notes.
